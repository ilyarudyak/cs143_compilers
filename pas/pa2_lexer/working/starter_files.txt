description
------------

  - cool.flex is a skeleton file for the specification of the
  lexical analyzer. You should complete it with your regular
  expressions, patterns and actions.

  - test.cl is a COOL program that you can test the lexical
  analyzer on. It contains some errors, so it won't compile with
  coolc. However, test.cl does not exercise all lexical
  constructs of COOL and part of your assignment is to rewrite
  test.cl with a complete set of tests for your lexical analyzer.

  - lextest.cc contains the main function which will call your
  lexer and print out the tokens that it returns.  DO NOT MODIFY.

  - mycoolc is a shell script that glues together the phases of the
  compiler using Unix pipes instead of statically linking code.  
  While inefficient, this architecture makes it easy to mix and match
  the components you write with those of the course compiler.
  DO NOT MODIFY.

  - cool-lexer.cc is the scanner generated by flex from cool.flex. 
  DO NOT MODIFY IT, as your changes will be overritten the next
  time you run flex.

  - stringtab.{cc|h} and stringtab_functions.h contains functions
  to manipulate the string tables.  DO NOT MODIFY.

  - utilities.{cc|h} contains functions used by the main() part of
  the lextest program. You may want to use the strdup() function
  defined in here. Remember that you should not print anything
  from inside cool.flex! DO NOT MODIFY.
